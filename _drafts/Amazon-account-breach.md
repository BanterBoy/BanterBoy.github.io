# <i class="fas fa-toilet" aria-hidden="true" style="color: white; margin-right:5px;"></i> Overview

Last Friday my son woke me in rather a panic, as he believed that he was the victim of a breach. He had already spoke to his mother and with me being the resident family expert on all things IT and Security, he was promptly told that he would have to wake me up. Having just been wrestled from my slumber, I mostly grunted and harrumphed and nodded my way through his description of events whilst trying to wake up. He explained that he had checked his bank account this morning to find that somehow, someone placed about 12 orders through his Amazon account but he had just changed his password in case this was how they had accessed his account.

Armed with all the relevant information, I now had to figure out what had actually happened and of course attempt to resolve the problem.

As my son was visibly distressed, he had neglected to sensibly wake me with a coffee but given the circumstances I was willing to let it go, so I got dressed and headed out to the man cave with my son in tow.

Once inside, I started making a coffee as nothing would get done without one, and began pondering my checklist while the kettle boiled.

Coffee ready, I sat down and began sifting through his amazon account settings......
