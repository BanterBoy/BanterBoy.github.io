My son woke me this morning in rather a panic as he believed that he was the victim of a breach. Having already spoke to his mother and with me being the resident family expert on all things IT and Security, he was anxious enough to poke the bear and wake me up. Having just been wrestled from my slumber, I mostly grunted and harrumphed my way through his description of events whilst trying to wake up. He explained that he had checked his bank account this morning to find that somehow, someone placed about 12 orders through his Amazon account and he had just changed his password in case this was how they had accessed his account.

Armed with all the relevant information I now had to figure out what had actually happened and of course attempt to resolve the problem.
