# Get-MerakiNetworks

## SYNOPSIS

Short function to provide details for an access policy configured on a specific network ID. Only valid for MS networks.
In order to use this Module you will need an API Key from your Dashboard.

## DESCRIPTION

Short function to provide details for an access policy configured on a specific network ID. Only valid for MS networks.

This function queries the Cisco Meraki API service <https://dashboard.meraki.com/api/v0> and will be needed for use with additional
commands within the module.

API Access is free but Rate Controlled and is limited to 5 calls per second (per organisation).

In order to use this Module you will need an API Key from your Dashboard. For access to the API, first enable the API for your
organisation under Organiation > Settings > Dashboard API access.

![Enable API Access](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BanterBoy/CiscoMeraki/master/assets/EnableAPIAccess.png)

After enabling the API, go to the **my profile** page to generate an API key. The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.

![Generate API Key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BanterBoy/CiscoMeraki/master/assets/GenerateKey.png)

****Note:*** Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.*

****Note*** that SAML dashboard administrators cannot view or generate API keys.*
